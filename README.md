# 🎓 Final Project – Custom Web Template

## 🧩 Introduction
This project is a **custom web template** created with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **native PHP**.  
It was developed as part of a **final university activity** for the degree program.  
The goal is to demonstrate basic web development skills, using only simple tools and a personal CSS style — without external frameworks.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – for page structure  
- **CSS3** – custom design, no external libraries  
- **PHP (native)** – for backend logic and database connection  
- **MySQL** – for data storage  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Import the `sipm.sql` file into your MySQL database.  
2. Edit the connection details in `BD.php` (host, user, password, database name).  
3. Start your local server (for example, XAMPP or WAMP).  
4. Open the project in your browser using the local address.
